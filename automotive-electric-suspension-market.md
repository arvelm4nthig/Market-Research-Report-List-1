<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Electric Suspension Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Suspension Type</li><li>Semi Active Suspension Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive electric suspension market is primarily categorized into two types: active suspension and semi-active suspension. Active suspension systems continuously adjust the suspension settings in response to road conditions, providing superior handling and comfort by actively controlling the stiffness and damping of each wheel. Semi-active suspension, on the other hand, adapts to driving conditions by modifying the damping force using sensors and actuators, offering a balance between performance and cost. Both types enhance vehicle stability and passenger comfort.</p></p>
