<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Knockdown Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>siRNA</li><li>shRNA</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gene knockdown market is primarily categorized into three types: siRNA (small interfering RNA), shRNA (short hairpin RNA), and other methodologies. siRNA involves synthetic double-stranded RNA molecules that silence specific genes by degrading their mRNA. shRNA, on the other hand, is transcribed from a DNA vector and forms a tighter hairpin structure, facilitating prolonged gene silencing. Other methods may include antisense oligonucleotides and CRISPR interference, expanding the toolkit for researchers targeting gene expression modulation in therapeutic and research settings.</p></p>
