<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Fixation Product Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spinal Fusion</li><li>Non-fusion Products</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal fixation product market is divided into two main types: spinal fusion and non-fusion products. Spinal fusion products are designed to stabilize the spine by permanently connecting adjacent vertebrae, often using hardware like rods and screws. In contrast, non-fusion products aim to provide stability without permanently fusing the bones, allowing for movement and natural healing, often employed in conditions where flexibility is crucial. These categories address varying patient needs and treatment approaches in spinal surgery.</p></p>
