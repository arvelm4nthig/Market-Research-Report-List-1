<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optic Photoelectric Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through-beam Sensors</li><li>Retro-reflective Sensors</li><li>Diffuse-reflective Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fiber optic photoelectric sensor market includes three primary types: through-beam sensors, retro-reflective sensors, and diffuse-reflective sensors. Through-beam sensors consist of transmitter and receiver units separated by a gap, detecting objects by interruption of the light beam. Retro-reflective sensors use a reflector to bounce light back, enabling detection without a direct line of sight. Diffuse-reflective sensors emit light that reflects off the object and returns to the sensor, allowing detection at varying distances based on surface properties.</p></p>
