<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Dialyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Flux Membrane</li><li>High Flux Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The disposable dialyzers market consists of two primary types: low flux membranes and high flux membranes. Low flux membranes are designed for patients with stable kidney function, effectively removing small toxins but limiting the clearance of larger molecules. In contrast, high flux membranes allow the passage of larger solutes and provide enhanced clearance of waste products, making them suitable for patients with more severe renal impairment. The choice between these membrane types depends on the patient's specific medical needs and dialysis treatment goals.</p></p>
