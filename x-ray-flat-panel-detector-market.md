<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-Ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect</li><li>Direct</li></ul></p>
<p><p>X-ray flat panel detectors (FPDs) are categorized into two market types: indirect and direct. Indirect FPDs utilize a two-step process where X-rays are first converted to visible light, which is then captured by a digital sensor. They typically offer better image quality but may have slower response times. In contrast, direct FPDs convert X-rays directly into electrical signals, providing faster imaging and compact designs. Both types are essential for various medical and industrial applications, influencing their specific market demands.</p></p>
